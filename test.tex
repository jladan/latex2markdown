\documentclass{article}


\section{This shouldn't show}

\begin{verbatim}
Technically, all of this isn't even proper \latex
\end{verbatim}

\begin{document}

% This is a comment!!!
\section{First, a test of span elements}
This is an \emph{emphasized} word, and another \textbf{bolded}, but \verb;this is a code segment;, and
an image \includegraphics{image-file.png} should be after ``image''.

\section{now a test of block elements}

The following is an unordered list:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The first item % none of this will be printed
    \item An item with some \emph{emphasized} text
    \item And this item is going to have multiple paragraphs...

        See? Does it work?
    \item A final item
\end{itemize}

Then, the same list, but ordered:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first item
    \item An item with some \emph{emphasized} text
    \item And this item is going to have multiple paragraphs...

        See? Does it work?
    \item A final item
\end{enumerate}

We'll throw in a block of code,
\begin{verbatim}
def function_name(argument):
    if argument:
        #% We probably should show this comment, however
        print(argument)
    for x in a_list:
        print(x)
\end{verbatim}

And finally, a block quote, just to see
\begin{quote}
And the great god Om spake unto Brutha,
'pssst.'
\end{quote}

I hope that all worked just fine.
\end{document}

There also shouldn't be anything printed after the document ends...
